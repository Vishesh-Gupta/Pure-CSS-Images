## Jolly Roger
The Jolly Roger (ドクロ Dokuro?), also known as a Pirate Flag (海賊旗 Kaizoku-ki?) is the traditional flag of European and Caribbean pirates, envisioned today as a skull over crossed thigh bones on a black field. Various versions of the Jolly Roger existed over the course of the centuries; for example, Calico Jack's Jolly Roger replaced the thigh bones with swords (cutlasses).

Oda himself provided some info on the Jolly Roger, including three possible theorized origins that have come to be accepted by experts:

    Some say it comes from the French term "jolie rouge" or "lovely red" possibly referring to blood.
    "Roger" may have come from the word "rogue" meaning thief or villain.
    It may have come from the term "old Roger" an old fashioned name for the Devil. 

The Jolly Roger is hugely recognized to mean "danger" worldwide. The skull and crossbones themselves are commonly used on to warn people about dangerous substances or places on signs and bottles.
