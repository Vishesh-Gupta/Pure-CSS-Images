# Pure-CSS-Images

I liked the concept of css design which I by luck through searching landed on codingartist.io, a web page managed and owned by Mike Mangialardi, and learned how to make pure css images. The first image taught by him is the Koala which made me love this so more.

I make the images in my free time and thus might not end up with a lot of commits. As soon as I think of something else I would like to make something. Please raise issues if you would like me to try to draw something more.
